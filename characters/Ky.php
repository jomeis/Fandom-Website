          <p class="indent">Where Ky's neutral shines in its versatility. He uses his far-reaching f.S and 2S to check opponents at mid range and complements them with his 6P or 6H, all of which have Disjointed Hitboxes, good reach and/or good frame data. 5K and 2D are lows for close range poking with many active frames. Frustrated foes that approach him carelessly can be intercepted by his strong space control tools and anti-airs. At longer ranges, Ky can use Stun Edge




 to contest zoning or apply Shock State, albeit with high risk and low damage. He can take more risks by using Stun Dipper




 as a quick Low Profile poke if he has meter to make it rewarding on hit and safe on block, or Foudre Arc




 to occasionally hard callout jumps or backdashes.

On the offensive, Ky is most notable for his safe Okizeme
 with his Charged Stun Edge




 and Meaty 5K, and basic but rewarding strike/throw with moves like 6H, 2D, and Dire Eclat




. With Shock State applied, Vapor Thrust




 enables high damage combos in the corner, and with Ride the Lightning




, Ky can easily carry opponents to the corner, break the wall and retain pressure while utilizing Positive Bonus to quickly regain the spent meter. Finally, if he gets the right knockdown and/or is close to the corner, he can get strong left/right mix-ups with airdash FDC safe jumps, or good high/low mix with j.D stalling in the air.

Ky's defensive options are varied, including a big but slow meterless DP
 in Vapor Thrust




 and his fast invincible Ride the Lightning Overdrive. He reliably scores great reward from his 2P Abare thanks to Dire Eclat providing a hard knockdown with far corner carry and Shock State. Furthermore, his aforementioned Stun Dipper shares the same startup speed as his 5P/2P jabs and is a highly rewarding abare option specifically when used with Roman Cancel to convert it into a combo on hit.</p>
