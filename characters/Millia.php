          <p class="indent">Her mobility makes traversing the battlefield a breeze. She runs quickly, has two air dashes, and two special moves that alter her air momentum (Turbo Fall




 and Kapel




) allowing her to easily whiff punish the opponent. She can also fish for knockdowns with ground attacks like f.S, 2K and 5K. Using 5K is especially powerful as it can gatling into itself for good mix-ups and stagger pressure.

Millia has access to unmatched okizeme due to her extremely powerful H Tandem Top




 projectile. She recovers mid-air before the disk is active, giving her ample time to mix her opponent with the many tools in her box of tricks. Her main low is 2K while her main highs are 6K, 5[D], and any air normal. Her j.H is especially notable due to its low hitbox and ability to hit both sides of Millia. She can even cross-up with an airdash or with Turbo Fall and Mirazh




 depending on the setup.

Millia's Mirazh also has the very unique and powerful ability to be special canceled mid-animation. This allows her to get better combo conversions she normally wouldn't get before or to make previous conversions more consistent and easier. It also brings her closer to her opponent after knockdowns allowing her to get better oki mixups or to even setup H Tandem Top in situations where she couldn't before.

Milliaâ€™s main weakness is her low health combined with her high R.I.S.C gain. This means that Millia is highly susceptible to "Touch of Death" or ToD combos, as well as losing fast in general. Furthermore, her defensive options are insignificant in balancing it all out. Her fastest jab, 2P, is particularly fast but has very little reward on-hit. Her only reversal is her Overdrive, Winger




, which has subpar horizontal range and is easy to punish. The invulnerability on her backdash is below average (4f), although it makes up for this by having a fast recovery (16f total duration). She also has a very low meter multiplier, causing her to generally gain less meter than her opponent does, making it hard to offset their offense with defensive tools like Faultless Defense, YRC, or Overdrive.</p>
