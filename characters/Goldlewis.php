          <p class="indent CharPaddingText">Goldlewis has three defining features to his gameplay: His unique movement, his Behemoth Typhoon, and his Security Gauge. But beyond that, Goldlewis is a character of extremes. His offensive tools are devastatingly powerful, but his defensive tools are notably poor. His tools to control his opponent's movement are amazing, but his slow speed and large body make it easier for the opponent to control his movement. When everything is put together, though, he's an absolute monster.</p>

          <p class="indent">What most separates Goldlewis apart from the cast is his Behemoth Typhoons. This move in its 16 total variations (8 on the ground, 8 in the air) is the cornerstone of Goldlewis' offense while also having significant application in neutral. Learning how to use each individual Behemoth Typhoon is key to mastering Goldlewis' offense. All Behemoths deal great damage and grant hard knockdown. In addition, the grounded versions cause a guard crush on block, increasing chip damage and frame advantage, preventing the opponent from using YRC, and enhancing his strike/throw game.

Goldlewis also has access to an additional resource in the Security Level. While not used as often as most other additional resources in the game, it grants access to stronger versions of Skyfish, Thunderbird, and Burn It Down. These primarily assist his neutral, with all three being a projectile of some sort. Skyfish is a great anti-zoning tool, Thunderbird acts as strong approach option as well as an amazing tool for okizeme, and Burn It Down serves as a last-resort option to force an interaction.</p>
