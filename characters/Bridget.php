          <p class="indent">Bridget is a well-rounded character who is easy to pick up and play, with high range, good mobility, a meterless reversal, and simple combos that lead into strong pressure situations. However, don't be fooled into thinking that means she's simple! Her Stop and Dash




 setplay projectile and Rolling Movement




 can be layered together and combined with her other tools in countless ways, giving her a uniquely expressive flair in her offense!

To complement this, Bridget has a fantastic suite of neutral tools. f.S and 5H reach very far, and possess both slightly disjointed hitboxes as well as follow-ups with fantastic corner carry that allow Bridget to start her offense on hit. Paired with her multi-hitting 2S to catch movement and help shore up the weakness to 6Ps and similar low profile options, she has the ability to assert dominant control over the ground. Her air control is similarly extremely strong, with j.H being one of the rare air normals to possess a significant disjoint, as well as her wide and high striking 2H.

On defense, Bridget has several strong options to work with, though she must be very careful when using them. A 5 frame and reasonably large 2K gives her Abare a bite many characters lack, and Starship




 is a perfectly serviceable meterless reversal, though she lacks an invincible Overdrive to beat throws and spaced okizeme. However, when she is forced onto the back foot, the specter of a 0 Guts Rating looms large. She will very frequently die to hits another character would survive with a decent buffer to spare. Combined with her lower than average damage, Bridget has to be right many more times than she is wrong.</p>
