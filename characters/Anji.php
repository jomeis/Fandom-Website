          <p class="indent CharPaddingText">Anji Mito uses his guile and wits to read the opponent's next moves and steal the spotlight when they misstep. The unique Autoguard property on his specials make them immune to normal strikes during their duration. If an opponent tries to take their turn too early, Anji can dance straight through their attack for a devastating punish. These and other tricky tools in Anji's kit are especially good for conditioning, guessing games, and dangerous RPS
 situations.</p>

          <p class="indent">Fuujin is his signature move with many graceful followups, the threat of which can force an opponent into risky options in the neutral game and in pressure after 5K or f.S. Shitsu fires a projectile butterfly that turns into a bird for starting offense from a knockdown. While he lacks plus-on-block moves to assert himself, Anji excels at stealing turns from the opponent by using the threat of his strong counter-hit starters and Autoguard to get away with leaving large gaps in his pressure. If the opponent tries to jump over Fuujin, Kou and 6P provide him excellent control of the air. Combined with throws, 2D, and baits, Anji's neutral and offense commands respect if you can enter someone's head.

This playstyle carries inherent, unavoidable risks. Each follow-up to Fuujin has their own counter-play that requires Anji to think one step ahead of the opponent at all times, especially if the opponent has access to an invincible reversal. Anji's defensive tools such as Kachoufuugetsu Kai also require some foresight, and bode doom for him if he whiffs them. He has limited options for mashing out of pressure, as 5P and 2P can only combo into 6P and only at point-blank range. All of Anji's Autoguard moves are vulnerable to throws, and RC slowdown.</p>
