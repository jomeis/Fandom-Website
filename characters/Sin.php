          <p class="indent">Sin Kiske is an aggressive rushdown character, sporting a powerful suite of tools for closing the distance, mixing up the opponent, and then tearing their life bar to shreds. However, these tools are limited by Sin's defining mechanic, the Stamina Gauge. As long as Sin has Stamina, he can cancel his special moves into followups that can frame trap and improve his frame data on block, or into Gazelle Step, a lightning fast dash that puts him right into his opponent's face. In addition, Stamina is also very important for combos, allowing Sin to convert good hits into long combos with great corner carry, and even allowing weaker hits to combo into Tyrant Barrel for good damage and a possible wallbreak.

However, this means that when he is without Stamina, Sin's options are far more limited. He loses access to many of his pressure options, and his reward on hit is reduced dramatically. Playing Sin requires one to be considerate of when to push their advantage, and when to back off and give themselves time to recover. He has a decent enough selection of tools for handling himself on the back foot, though nothing spectacular. His 2S and 5K are solid pokes in neutral, and Beak Driver hits from very far away, though its hurtbox leaves much to be desired. He fares much better against airborne opponents, with 6P, 5P, and j.H providing stellar control over his airspace. On defense, Hawk Baker is a strong DP, though the minigame around its follow up can be bypassed completely by punishing it before the second hit.</p>
